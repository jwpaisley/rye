## Running a Program in Rye
To interpret a program written in Rye, use the command `rye <filename> (-p)`.
The `-p` flag is optional and will print the file contents to file prior to evaluation.

## Begin & End
A valid Rye program's first line is the keyword `begin` and its last line is the keyword `end`.

## Comments
To write a comment in a Rye file, start your comment with `/=` and end it with `=/`. An example of a valid comment in Rye would be `/= This is a comment! =/`. Nothing in a comment is evaluated, so be sure to close the comment. Line comments do not exist in Rye.
